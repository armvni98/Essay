Abstract 

An aortic aneurysm is a chronic, potentially fatal, vascular disease that forms a balloon-like bulge in the aorta. Medical imaging plays a substantial role in detecting and monitoring aortic aneurysms, from the moment symptoms first appear until the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Through multiple types of imaging, we can observe that the most common manifestations are how the blood flows, the inner arterial wall, and the size and shape of an aneurysm. The anatomical imaging tests that diagnose an aortic aneurysm are x-ray, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound is the most common test performed using sound waves and not with dangerous radiation. CT scan uses cross-sectional imaging to detect the size and shape of an aneurysm, and precise images of the structures inside of the belly or chest area by taking an MRI. This paper's overview of aortic aneurysms highlights the relevance of imaging in parts of the disease.

Imaging an Aortic Aneurysm
           Aortic Aneurysm (AA) is a condition that permanently enlarges the aorta, most frequently found in the infrarenal and proximal thoracic areas (Davis et al., 2019).  The abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) are the two forms of aortic aneurysms that are the focus of this research paper. Both categories are distinct conditions with unique risk factors and etiologies. The most common location for an aneurysm is in the abdomen. A protuberance in the aorta, the principal blood vessel that travels from the heart to the chest and abdomen, is known as an abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm (National Health Service, 2020). The abdominal aorta traverses the stomach region. It transports blood enriched in oxygen from the heart to the tissues and organs of the lower limbs and abdomen. Less frequently, a thoracic aortic aneurysm develops above the diaphragm in the chest part of the aorta (Diagnosis, 2022). It can be challenging to diagnose AAAs and TAAs because they frequently develop slowly. Some aneurysms do not rupture because they start small and do not grow while others expand over time occasionally quickly (Mayo Clinic, 2021). Imaging is a crucial component of the diagnostic process together with physical examination and laboratory testing for early condition detection since the signs do not show easily. 
           AAAs and TAAs tend to go undetected and usually discovered through screens or exams performed for other reasons. A throbbing sensation in the stomach that resembles a heartbeat, chronic abdominal pain, and recurrent lower back pain are a few symptoms that patients with AAs encounter. If the AA ruptures, the symptoms worsen and one can feel dizziness, have sweaty and clammy skin, and experience arrhythmia and atherosclerosis (National Health Service, 2020). Some factors that increase the risk of AA are high blood pressure or cholesterol, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, family history of AA, smoking, and cardiovascular disease. Experts recommend getting an ultrasound yearly, for those that are at risk, to rule out an aortic aneurysm. The recommended treatment for AA depends on its size. Treatment is typically not necessary right away if there is a small possibility that an AA may rupture (National Health Service, 2020). 
Etiology
           Conditions leading to the breakdown or aberrant formation of the elastin and collagen that make up the aortic wall cause aortic aneurysms. Degenerative illnesses, genetic or developmental diseases, vasculitis, infections, and trauma are major categories of aortic aneurysm that causes the most significant issue concerning smoking (Creager & Loscalzo, 2022, pg. 1-14). Other causes include atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, and excessive cholesterol (Aortic Aneurysm | cdc.gov, 2021). Most abdominal and descending thoracic aortic aneurysms are characterized by degenerative processes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, proteolysis, and biomechanical wall stress (Creager & Loscalzo, 2022, pg. 1-14). “These are mediated by B-cell and T-cell lymphocytes, macrophages, inflammatory cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases that degrade elastin and collagen and alter the tensile strength and ability of the aorta to accommodate pulsatile stretch” (Creager & Loscalzo, 2022, pg. 1-14). For instance, familial clustering is thought to be responsible for the genetics of aortic aneurysms, which affect 20% of patients. Researchers found mutations of the gene fibrillin-1, which is an important component that supports the building of elastic fibers and connective tissue, therefore, lack of fibrillin-1 in the extracellular matrix causes transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) to signal excessively. TAAs may be brought on by extreme TGF-β signaling (Creager & Loscalzo, 2022, pg. 1-14). 


Manifestations 
           Aortic aneurysm mainly occurs in the aorta in the abdomen or the chest, although it can occur anywhere in the aorta. AA can affect the branches that come off the aorta and supply blood to organs, such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestines. AA can also increase the risk of aortic dissection (Department of Surgery - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, 2022). They are divided into several groups based on the location within the aorta: 
Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA): Most abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAs) occur in the abdomen. Although many abdominal aortic aneurysms are unnoticeable during diagnosis, rupture with hemorrhage remains the most common complication (Department of Surgery - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, 2022). 
Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (TAA) occurs in the upper portion of the aorta and the chest; these can easily rupture. There are 3 subdivisions: ascending aortic aneurysm, aortic arch aneurysm, and descending thoracic aneurysm (Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm, 2021). 
Thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAAA) refers to aneurysms in the aorta's thoracic and abdominal regions (Mayo Clinic, 2021). 
Visceral Artery Aneurysms: The aorta branches that supply blood to vital organs like the liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestines can also develop (Department of Surgery - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, 2022).
The majority of aortic aneurysms do not cause symptoms (Department of Surgery - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, 2022).  Therefore, it can be challenging to determine when someone is experiencing an aneurysm. However, while a patient is assessed for another medical issue using a CT scan (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), many aneurysms are discovered incidentally (Department of Surgery - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, 2022). In addition, because symptoms typically do not manifest until the aneurysm grows large or ruptures, individuals might not be aware that they could potentially have a thoracic aortic aneurysm (Beckerman, 2021). 
Aortic aneurysms are less prevalent in women than men, with rates of approximately 1.0-2.2% in women and 1.3-8.9% in men (Mathur et al., 2016). Other risk factors such as advanced age, smoking, and a history of aortic aneurysms especially in first-degree male relatives have shown to increase the likelihood of developing AA. Additionally, the risk of AA is increased by having a history of coronary artery disease, greater height, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and other vascular aneurysms (Mathur et al., 2016). Males are affected by aortic aneurysms at a ratio of 4:1, but females are known to have worse results (Malayala et al. 2020). Research suggests that ruptured aneurysms are more common and smaller in diameter in women than men. The risk for a rupture in an aneurysm is less than or equal to 6 cm. Women are more prone to rupture than men with a percentage of 14.1% for men and 22.3% for women. Mortality due to AA rupture is about 50% (Malayala et al. 2020).

Figure 1 Men with an initial AAA of 3-5 cm had a mean growth rate of 0-26 cm/year, ranging from 0-28 cm, over the first five years of follow-up, which increased to 0-80 cm/year after 15–19 years—adapted from Oliver-Williams, C., Sweeting, M. J., Turton, G., Parkin, D., Cooper, D., Rodd, C., Thompson, S. G., & Earnshaw, J. J. (2017b). Lessons learned about prevalence and growth rates of abdominal aortic aneurysms from a 25-year ultrasound population screening programme. British Journal of Surgery, 105(1), 68–74. https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10715. Copyright 2017 by British Journal of Surgery. 
Age is also an important risk factor for aortic aneurysms. The chance of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) increases after the age of 60 and has a high prevalence rate of 4%–8% worldwide (Alnefaie et al., 2022). A family history of AAA increases the risk of developing this condition, highlighting age- and gender-related risks. Siblings of people with known aneurysms over the age of 60 have an up to 18% risk of developing an aneurysm (Dalman & Mell, 2021). 
Smoking is the most powerful risk factor for aortic aneurysms. The walls of the aorta become weak by smoking, making it more likely that an aortic aneurysm will form and rupture. An aortic aneurysm is more likely to occur if an individual smokes or chew tobacco for an extended period. Men aged 65 to 75 who smoke or previously smoked are encouraged to have a one-time abdominal ultrasound to check for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (Mayo Clinic, 2021). 
Diagnosis
As a person ages, the individual is recommended to get a screening done. The ESC guidelines on aortic disorders advocate population screening with the use of abdominal ultrasonography in all males aged >65 years, considering the natural history of AAAs. Additionally, women over 65 who smoke or who have a history of smoking, as well as first-degree relatives of individuals with AAA2, can be considered for abdominal ultrasound screening (Bossone & Eagle, 2020, pg. 331–348). A thoracic aortic aneurysm screening may be performed on specific populations. They consist of people with Marfan, Loeys–Dietz, Ehlers–Danlos, or Turner syndromes. The relation between these syndromes is that they are connected to heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTD). HCTD was found by identifying mutations in genes encoding structural proteins, modifying enzymes, or components of the TGFβ-signaling pathway (Meester et al., 2017, pg. 582-594). Parents, children, and siblings of people with thoracic aortic aneurysms or bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)-associated thoracic aortic aneurysms are considered first-degree relatives (Diagnosis, 2022). Imaging plays an important role in reaching an accurate diagnosis. 
Imaging
The majority of aortic aneurysms are found incidentally. Imaging plays a significant role in monitoring the disease's growth and assists physicians in coming up with a treatment plan for the patients. Anatomical imaging techniques like x-ray, ultrasound, CT, and MRI are typically used to diagnose AAA (Hong et al., 2010). In comparison to other anatomical imaging methods, ultrasonography is non-invasive, rapid, inexpensive, less technically demanding, and quite accurate, making it perfect for routine screening (Hong et al., 2010). As the disease progresses, various combinations of radiography, ultrasound, CT (Helical CT and Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)), MRI, and aortography can be used to visualize certain aortic aneurysm characteristics.
Radiography
           Conventional radiography (x-ray) is more affordable and more widely available than other modalities. The first imaging to rule out a thoracic aortic aneurysm may be a chest x-ray (Creager & Loscalzo, 2022, pg. 1-14). “Findings include widening of the mediastinal shadow and displacement or compression of the trachea or left main stem bronchus” (Creager & Loscalzo, 2022, pg. 1-14). PA chest x-rays usually show the findings better than lateral chest X-rays. In the anterior, posterior, and lateral views of the chest and abdomen, aortic calcification may indicate the aneurysm's boundaries. Although retrosternal air space loss is shown on lateral films, the heart may completely obscure the aneurysm, making the chest radiograph appear normal (Singh, 2021). On plain radiographs of the abdomen, calcification of the abdominal aortic wall is frequently visible, as shown in the images below. On lateral views, when the spine does not obscure the vessel's opposing walls, calcification is best seen (Radvany, 2021). However, x-ray images do not give in-depth details of the aorta which requires more diagnostic imaging.

Ultrasonography 
           Due to its widespread accessibility and low cost, ultrasonography is another modality that is frequently employed in the assessment of AAs. It continues to be the primary tool for identifying related aneurysms and assessing the progression of known aneurysms (Sparks, 2002). Transesophageal echocardiography, or TEE, is a highly sensitive method for diagnosing aortic pathologies and provides an evaluation of cardiac structure and function. It has been reported that TEE images of intimal membranes for signs of aortic dissection are 90% accurate (Singh, 2021). One-time ultrasonographic screening for AAA is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for men aged 65-75 who have a history of smoking (i.e., "ever smoker": somewhere around 100 cigarettes during their lifetime (Radvany, 2021). In general, ultrasound has been extensively utilized for AAA screening and diagnosis. However, in many clinical situations, its usefulness may be limited by patient obesity or bowel gas. Additionally, ultrasonography is not as precise as CT angiography and cannot entirely replace it (Hong et al., 2010).

Computed Tomography
           Computed Tomography is also used to diagnose and treat aortic aneurysms. Thoracic aortic aneurysms are characterized by an increase in aortic diameter and an outward displacement of calcium from the aortic wall on a computed tomography scan (Singh, 2021). In the diagnosis of AAA, contrast-enhanced CT has been widely used. Although the associated accumulated radiation dose is a concern for individuals due to scans that are performed routinely, CT is the preferred method for more accurate follow-up of AAA due to its speed, reproducibility, and spatial resolution (Creager & Loscalzo, 2022, pg. 1-14). By using CT, the maximum diameter of the aneurysm can be accurately determined, and the diameter tracked over time (Singh, 2021). An aneurysm that increases above 4 cm is considered a rupturable aneurysm, therefore needs to be monitored regularly. Nevertheless, when the diameter of an aortic aneurysm is greater than 6 cm, monitoring the aneurysm is not enough and it usually requires surgery (Singh, 2021).

           Anatomic variants and AAA etiology can be accurately identified with CT. Rapid spiral CT scanning, CT angiography (CTA), multiplanar reconstruction, and 3-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction are all now readily available. When CT is performed for a variety of abdominal symptoms, the incidental diagnosis of AAA has been made possible. With some degree of certainty, CT can be used to diagnose mycotic, inflammatory, and ruptured AAA (Davis, 2011). The size and extent of the aneurysm, as well as the involvement of other organs, can be determined by a well-executed CT scan (Radvany, 2021). To get the most out of CT, a contrast agent may be injected into the patient's veins; regardless, with or without contrast enhancement, CT is an excellent screening examination for AAA. The other abdominal organs are also visible on a CT scan, which may obscure the clinical picture by revealing organ involvement or relocation. It is simple to measure the lengths of the neck and iliac arteries, the size of the aneurysm, the level of calcification, and the existence of a mural thrombus (Radvany, 2021). CT is an important factor when it comes to diagnosing an aortic aneurysm.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
           Magnetic Resonance Imaging is also another common diagnostic and follow-up procedure for aortic aneurysm conditions. The aneurysm's size, shape, and location can all be determined by MRI (Creager & Loscalzo, 2022, pg. 1-14). Axial, sagittal, and coronal images are all possible with MRI. When contrast is added to an MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, it further enhances the characteristics of aneurysms and provides greater detail for the vascular surgeon to monitor the aneurysm's growth and/or plan for its surgical repair but it can also be performed without any contrast agents (Sakalihasan et al., 2018). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a form of MRI sequence that assesses the movement of water molecules in tissues. As a result, DWI MRI can help with the functional evaluation of AA because it is sensitive to cellular density (Sakalihasan et al., 2018). Although MRI cannot be used in an emergency, it is crucial as an additional imaging technique, particularly for patients who cannot use iodinated CT contrast agents but still need high-resolution images (Sakalihasan et al., 2018). In the context of customized diagnosis and post-procedural surveillance of patients with aortic aneurysms, MRI seems promising for addressing specific clinical problems (Salehi Ravesh et al., 2019). 
           For patients with thoracic aortic diseases, MRI and MRA are the preferred methods of follow-up because they are noninvasive and offer images along both the short and long axes of the thoracic aorta (Singh, 2021). The sagittal plane of MRA is useful for showing the relationship between the aneurysm and the arch branches and visceral arteries of the abdominal aorta (Sparks et al., 2002). However, because a patient must remain motionless for a longer period of time than with the current multidetector-row helical CT technology, MRI is more sensitive to motion than CT (Radvany, 2021).

Prognosis and Treatment 
           With a prevalence of 2% to 5% in men under 65, aortic aneurysm is a common diagnosis in the Western population and a major cause of death from rupture. The course of treatment includes either open or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) (Beck et al., 2016). Due to this, imaging in different modalities is available to get a better diagnosis of the disease and to monitor the aneurysm. Preventing an aneurysm from rupturing is the goal of treatment for aortic aneurysms. Due to its less intrusive nature and reduced rate of surgical mortality, endovascular aortic repair using a stent, has grown to be the preferred treatment for patients with appropriate aortic anatomy (Beck et al., 2016). The direct formation of the AA wall is impractical. Instead, in addition to clinical indications (such as pain and/or fever), a radiological diagnosis becomes crucial (Muramatsu, 2022). “On CT and MRI, the AA is seen as a localized, contrast-enhanced, lobulated saccular lumen with an uneven, unclear aortic wall” (Muramatsu, 2022). When gas bubbles appear inside and around the AA, it is highly effective in diagnosing the AA (Muramatsu, 2022). Therefore, imaging analyses must support the decision about surgical eligibility and, if surgical indications are present, guide the repair plan (Kallianos & Burris, 2020). 
Conclusion
           Aortic aneurysms are bulges or calcifications that form inside the aorta and block blood flow. Despite impressive advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic methods, the prevalence of aortic illnesses is still significantly high (Bossone & Eagle, 2020, pg. 331–348). In many cases, AA is discovered as an incidental finding in imaging, therefore, it is important to get the recommended screenings done on time. Early detection and treatment of aortic aneurysms can increase survival and prognosis. Utilizing multiple imaging modalities is crucial because each modality showcases different depths inside the body identifying distinct characteristics of an aortic aneurysm. Although there are many other possible causes of AA (genetic, degenerative, and inflammatory), the majority of these conditions are treated using the maximal aortic diameter as a measurement guide to decide on the type of treatment (Kallianos & Burris, 2020). 
Treatment can begin after the disease is identified. The diagnosis and treatment of aortic aneurysms rely heavily on imaging. Some treatments that are recommended for an aortic aneurysm are receiving endovascular aortic repair surgery and regular monitoring if the aneurysm is benign. The physician may recommend surgery depending on the size of the aortic aneurysm. New treatments and technology are forming every year that help in getting a step closer to treating aortic aneurysms permanently. Finally, there is much optimism for improved aortic disease detection, prevention, and therapy in the future because of developments in genetics and both dynamic and disease-specific imaging (Bossone & Eagle, 2020, pg. 331–348).
